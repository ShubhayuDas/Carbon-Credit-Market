README.md

* Install node (v8.9.0). If alreadly installed used the nvm-sh/nvm library for versioning

* Install truffle (v5.0.2) with solidity (v0.5.0)

* run 'npm install' from inside the project's directory (my need to run 'npm audit fix' after that)

* Run ganash

* sync with Metamask (make sure all the public IPs / accounts show up)

* Run truffle compile and migrate (with --reset if needed)

* Move to the 'src' directory and run 'npm run dev' to open up the front end 



NOTE: please use my teammate's (Hrittik Roy: hrittik.roy@usi.ch) code for deploying the front end - the final project demo recorded by him had he added a few things in the html file
